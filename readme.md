# Linkedin Automation

Have you ever went to an online event, where a lot of people want to connect with you?
They all share their linkedin name or link with you, and it takes you forever to click on each link and 
connect with each person. 

Well, why not automate it? 

This may seem a trivial problem with somewhat trivial solution. This CLI app will allow you to work with lists of links or names to find and connect with with them on linkedin.
